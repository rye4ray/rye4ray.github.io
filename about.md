## About Me

I'm a computational chemist who has an interest in coding. I'm currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley where I study the structures of intrinsically disordered proteins and their complexes using computational tools in connection with experimental data. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, and training for (half-)marathon races.
