## About Me

I'm a computational chemist who has an interest in coding. I'm currently a PhD candidate at The Ohio State University where I study protein structure, dynamics, and function using molecular dynamics simulations. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, and training for (half-)marathon races.
