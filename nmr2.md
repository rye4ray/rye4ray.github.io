## AMBER ff99SBnmr2

AMBER ff99SBnmr2 "nmr2" is a protein force field developed by me and co-workers in the Br√ºschweiler group at The Ohio State University for realistic simulations of both folded and disordered proteins. nmr2 is a residue-specfic protein force field that is derived from ff99SBnmr1 by balancing the backbone dihedral angle potentials in a residue-specific manner to quantitatively reproduce dihedral angle distributions from an experimental coil library.
